## Jaroslaw Roman Cudzich

#### Full Stack Junior Developer

**Recent graduate of one of the most prestigious and selective computer programming bootcamps worldwide, Makers Academy, accompanied with over 10 years of experience in the information technology and audio visual technology fields.**  In my role prior to joining Makers, I was an Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician for 6.5 years at Allen & Overy, a distinguished member of UK's Magic Circle of leading law firms.  This challenging role required an extensive amount of fault diagnostics and problem resolution attributes which are vital for the success of the Audio Visual and Multimedia, as well as the Information Technology departments as a whole.  This role was a natural stepping-stone for me to further challenge myself through the instinctive progression into computer programming.  I am ready and eager to take on the challenges ahead involved with staring my journey as a software developer.  I am intrigued with the possibilities of understanding how software programs work from within, through the DNA of the equipment I have worked with thus far, through coding.
