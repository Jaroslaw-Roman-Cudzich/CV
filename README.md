**Recent Makers Academy graduate eager to start a challenging journey as a full stack junior developer.**  In my role prior to joining Makers, I was an Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician for more than 6 years at Allen & Overy, a distinguished member of UK's Magic Circle of leading law firms.  This challenging role required an extensive amount of fault diagnostics and problem resolution attributes which are vital for the success of the Audio Visual and Multimedia, as well as the Information Technology departments as a whole.  This role was a natural stepping-stone for me to further challenge myself through the instinctive progression into computer programming.  As an active member of the Allen & Overy Code Club I met with other Code Club members on a weekly basis to enhance our programming skills through virtual Zoom coding sessions.

My continuous thirst for knowledge and problem-solving mind-set reinforces my preparedness and keenness to take on the challenges ahead involved with starting my journey as a developer.  Whether the task at hand involves working as a team or on a project solo, I have the collaborative mind-set, natural drive, and self-discipline necessary to make a significant contribution to the enterprise and its clientele as a whole.  I am intrigued with the possibilities of understanding how programs work from within, through the DNA of the applications I have worked with in my career thus far, through coding.
