### <a name="profile">Profile</a>
Recent Makers Academy graduate eager to start a challenging journey as a full stack junior developer.  In my role prior to joining Makers, I was an Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician for more than 6 years at Allen & Overy, a distinguished member of UK's Magic Circle of leading law firms.  This challenging role required an extensive amount of fault diagnostics and problem resolution attributes which are vital for the success of the Audio Visual and Multimedia, as well as the Information Technology departments as a whole.  This role was a natural stepping-stone for me to further challenge myself through the instinctive progression into computer programming.  As an active member of the Allen & Overy Code Club I met with other Code Club members on a weekly basis to enhance our programming skills through virtual Zoom coding sessions.

My continuous thirst for knowledge and problem-solving mind-set reinforces my preparedness and keenness to take on the challenges ahead involved with starting my journey as a developer.  Whether the task at hand involves working as a team or on a project solo, I have the collaborative mind-set, natural drive, and self-discipline necessary to make a significant contribution to the enterprise and its clientele as a whole.  I am intrigued with the possibilities of understanding how programs work from within, through the DNA of the applications I have worked with in my career thus far, through coding.

Please see below the software engineering projects I would like to highlight during my Makers Academy course.  The projects are listed in reverse chronological order in order to demonstrate the change in complexity of the programming accomplished, with the most recent and complex project being the first one in the list.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

##### Problem solving and fault diagnostics
I am thankful for the many challenges I have come across in my years of experience taking on the testing and yet rewarding role of tackling complex technical issues on a daily basis in high pressure environments as an Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician.  Every few minutes of an unresolved technical failure often meant a significant monetary and even reputational loss to the one of the most distinguished international commercial law firms, Allen & Overy, in the world.  I was honoured with the mission of resolving technical issues at hand quickly and efficiently along with training and leading other technicians to do the same.  

##### Highly adaptable mind-set
The COVID-19 pandemic created new challenges and opportunties for the entire Audio Visual and Multimedia department in its adaptation to the completely new and uncharted territory presented.  We went from working with state of the art Audio Visual and Information Technology equipment onsite to ensuring no disruption to the business growth of Allen & Overy during the pandemic by taking all of the business meetings, presentations, workshops, sessions, etc. to virtual and hybrid levels.  The department enabled the enterprise's business to continue by bringing the business home through my team doing fault disagnosis, organising, and leading the technical aspects of the virtual sessions.  This involved working with new technologies and taking on a completely new role.

##### Ability and willingness to learn new programming languages and tools
One of the key compenents of being a successful student at Makers Academy is the adaptive and self-learning mind-set necessary to learn new programming tools and languages.  MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Ruby, Capybara, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, and Heroku are just some of the technology stack languages and tools I have proactively created programs with at Makers Academy.  

##### Test Driven Development - Clean and very well tested code
I proactively follow the principles of Test Driven Development to ensure high quality code.  I write clean code to make the program easier to maintain, understand, and de-bug.  These are some of the key components of the Makers Academy curriculum.  

##### A leader and team player
As an In-House Technical Events Manager at the Park PLaza Riverbank Hotel, I was solely in charge of all the audio visual operational, technical, management, and sales aspects of the department. I embraced my lead role as both a manager
and technician to ensure a successful completion of every event in a structured, safe, and timely manner.  As a team player I collaborated with my colleagues from the Information Technology and Engineering departments, along with integrated system installation companies to ensure a safe and reliable
state of the art installation and maintenance of the audio visual equipment.  At Allen & Overy, I was the most Senior Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician within the department where I led other Technicians in day to day duties and projects at hand.  I worked as part of a team through consistent collaboration with Information Technology, Dimension Data, Audio Visual Engineers, and Programmers.   

##### Attention to detail
Through my past experience in working with very prestigious clientele, I have developed a keen eye for fine details.  I am able to understand how the many pieces of the program work together, as well as locate that one tiny bug which prevents the code from running as intended.
