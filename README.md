### <a name="profile">Profile</a>
Recent Makers Academy graduate eager to start a challenging journey as a full stack junior developer.  In my role prior to joining Makers, I was an Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician for more than 6 years at Allen & Overy, a distinguished member of UK's Magic Circle of leading law firms.  This challenging role required an extensive amount of fault diagnostics and problem resolution attributes which are vital for the success of the Audio Visual and Multimedia, as well as the Information Technology departments as a whole.  This role was a natural stepping-stone for me to further challenge myself through the instinctive progression into computer programming.  As an active member of the Allen & Overy Code Club I met with other Code Club members on a weekly basis to enhance our programming skills through virtual Zoom coding sessions.

My continuous thirst for knowledge and problem-solving mind-set reinforces my preparedness and keenness to take on the challenges ahead involved with starting my journey as a developer.  Whether the task at hand involves working as a team or on a project solo, I have the collaborative mind-set, natural drive, and self-discipline necessary to make a significant contribution to the enterprise and its clientele as a whole.  I am intrigued with the possibilities of understanding how programs work from within, through the DNA of the applications I have worked with in my career thus far, through coding.

##### Problem solving and fault diagnostics
I am thankful for the many challenges I have come across in my years of experience taking on the testing and yet rewarding role of tackling complex technical issues on a daily basis in high pressure environments as an Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician.  Every few minutes of an unresolved technical failure often meant a significant monetary and even reputational loss to the one of the most distinguished international commercial law firms, Allen & Overy, in the world.  I was honoured with the mission of resolving technical issues at hand quickly and efficiently along with training and leading other technicians to do the same.  

##### Highly adaptable mind-set
The COVID-19 pandemic created new challenges and opportunties for the entire Audio Visual and Multimedia department in its adaptation to the completely new and uncharted territory presented.  We went from working with state of the art Audio Visual and Information Technology equipment onsite to ensuring no disruption to the business growth of Allen & Overy during the pandemic by taking all of the business meetings, presentations, workshops, sessions, etc. to virtual and hybrid levels.  The department enabled the enterprise's business to continue by bringing the business home through my team doing fault disagnosis, organising, and leading the technical aspects of the virtual sessions.  This involved working with new technologies and taking on a completely new role.

##### A leader and team player
At Allen & Overy, I was the most Senior Audio Visual and Multimedia Technician within the department where I led other Technicians in day to day duties and projects at hand.
